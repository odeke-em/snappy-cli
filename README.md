# snappy-cli

Simple CLI utility for the [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) compression format.

Contains two complementary CLI utilities, one for compressing, the other for decompressing i.e. `snappy-compress` and `snappy-uncompress`.

Note that both utils:

* Read either from stdin or from a file on disk passed in as a path.
* Output their result to stdout.
